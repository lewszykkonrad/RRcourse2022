The Suits tells a story of a happy lawyer called ***Harvey Specter*** and he meets a new happy friend ***Mike*** and he helps him to become a lawyer too. Now ***Harvey and Mike*** can be happy friends and happy lawyers as well.

summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
